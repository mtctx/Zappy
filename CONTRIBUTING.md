## Getting Started

### Set Up Your Development Environment

Hereâ€™s how to get your local setup ready:

1. **Install the prerequisites**
   Make sure you have **JDK 21** or later installed.

2. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mtctx/Squishy.git
   cd Squishy
   ```

3. **Open the project**
   Open the `Squishy` folder in your favorite IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code with Kotlin plugins work great). Gradle
   should automatically detect the modules for you.

4. **Run the project**

   ```bash
   ./gradlew run
   ```

   This will build everything you need and start the Squishy client.

* A **short, clear title** describing the problem
* **Steps to reproduce** the issue
* **What you expected** to happen vs. **what actually happened**
* Your **Squishy version**
* Your **OS and system info**
* Any **logs or screenshots** that help explain the problem

   ```

3. **Make your changes** in the relevant module(s).

4. **Write clear commit messages**.

5. **Push your branch**:
